# 🐦 AI-Driven Bioacoustic Analysis

This project is part of an academic research thesis focused on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze and interpret bioacoustic data — sounds produced by living organisms such as birds, marine mammals, insects, and amphibians.

The objective is to build a robust pipeline for automated sound classification and species identification using deep learning models, supporting biodiversity research and ecological monitoring.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Extract meaningful features (e.g. spectrograms, MFCCs) from raw audio.
- ✅ Implement AI models (CNNs, RNNs, Transformer-based) for sound classification.
- 🔄 Evaluate model performance on publicly available datasets.
- 🚀 Explore real-time/edge deployment (e.g., Raspberry Pi or mobile devices).
